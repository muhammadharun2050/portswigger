                  #ssrf vulnerabality#
1. check stock vunnerabality
2.remove vulnerable peremeter from 
stock(stockapi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check?productId=1&storeId=1)
 and try(stockapi= http://localhost/admin)
3.try redirection and delete account.

               #Basic SSRF against another back-end system#
1.remove all peramiter and use new url after peramiter(example:http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin) 
2. sent to intruder and selet ip last digit(1) and set 1-6000 as you want.
3.then brute force .

                #SSRF with whitelist-based input filters#
1.remove url and use loacl ip (http://localhost) if it does not work use 127.0.0.1 or (127.1)	
2. 127.0.0.1 make it decimal version.
3. use http://127.1/admin (here 'admin' 'a' double encode) 
4. after find admin delete panel user and you follow redirection and come back host/admin pannel .

                #SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability#
1. intercept stock and sent repeter
2. intercept again   and go next product and sent repter. 
3. next path use first stock path (stockApi=/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&
path=https://192.168.0.1:8080/)
4. encode url
5. use localhost (192.168.0.1:8080) and sent intercept alone with slect 1 and bruteforce 
4.	at last ((stockApi=/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&
path=https://192.168.0.1:8080/admin) 	and delete 

                    mote: must check   "blind ssrf with colabator "

                # SSRF with whitelist-based input filter# 		
				
1. cheeck stockapi and change peramiter and use any arbitary url. but it doen not work.
2. becarefully check response and you find a whitelistb url(stock.weliketoshop.net). this url use stockapi peramir.
but it does not work. next step bypass ......
3. (stockApi=localhost:80#@stock.weliketoshop.net) this # symble encode twice .
4. find /admin and use this and find carlos admin
